Justification
--------------
For my replication experiment I have chosen to replicate Study 3 of Storm and Stone's "Saving-Enhanced Memory: The Benefits of Saving on the Learning and Remembering of New Information" from the 2015 Journal of Psychological Science. I am a PhD student in the Learning Sciences and Technology Design program and generally interested in how technology can influence cognitive processes. The chosen study examines the effect of saving a document on future learning and memory. The study concludes that when a student has the opportunity to save a file before studying another file, they retain more information from this second studying session becasue interference is lower.

Stimuli and Procedures
----------------------
<u>Stimuli</u><br>
-16 PDF files: each with a list of 8 common nouns (4 to 7 letters long).

<u>Procedure</u><br>
Participants are assigned to either the 2-word File A condition or the 8-word File A condition. They will experience a save trial and a no-save trial at outset, then 6 experimental trials will be presented in semi-random order, 3 save trials and 3 no-save trials. 

For all trials participants will have 15 seconds to study file A, which contains two or eight words depending on experimental condition. Then participants will either save the file with knowledge that they can return and study it later, or close the file without saving, depending on trial condition. Participants will then count backwards by 3 from a random digit between 200 and 999 for 20 seconds. After counting backwards, subjects will study file B(always 8 words) for 15 seconds. Participant will then be immediately tested on recall for file B for 20 seconds. If it is a save trial then participants can go back and study file A for another 15 seconds before the file A recall test(also 20 seconds), otherwise subjects go straight to the recall test. At the end of each trial participants are given a Tetris game to play for one minute before beginning the next trial. 

Online Challenges
----------
Since this experiment tests memory over several repeated trials, participants may start taking screenshots or writing words down when studying. Therefore, it will be important that we monitor unusual test scores and include a message in the beginning advising participants not to cheat. Another challenge will be creating an javascript environment where participants can access and save files. The recall test must be modified so that participants write down words instead of vocalizaing what they recall.
